Four moles of an ideal diatomic gas ($C_V=5R/2$) are taken from $A$ to $B$ by the \emph{straight} path shown on the $pV$ diagram in Figure 1 below.

\question The heat flow $Q$ into the gas during the process from $A$ to $B$ is closest to: \\
\mcs{0\,kJ}{5\,kJ}{15\,kJ}{25\,kJ}{35\,kJ}

\begin{solution}
25\,kJ
\end{solution}
