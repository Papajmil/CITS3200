Four moles of an ideal diatomic gas ($C_V=5R/2$) are taken from $A$ to $B$ by the \emph{straight} path shown on the $pV$ diagram in Figure \ref{ht1} below.

%Heat and Thermodynamics exam question 3

\question  The change of internal energy $\D U$ of the gas for the process from $A$ to $B$ is closest to: \\
\mcs{0\,J}{500\,J}{1000\,J}{2500\,J}{5000\,J}

\begin{solution}
5000\,J
\end{solution}
