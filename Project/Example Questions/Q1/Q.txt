%Heat and Thermodynamics exam question 1

\question Five moles of an ideal monatomic gas with an initial temperature of $127\dc$ expand and, in the process, absorb 1200\,J of heat and do 2100\,J of work.  The final temperature of the gas is closest to:\\
\mcs{$100\dc$}{$110\dc$}{$120\dc$}{$130\dc$}{$140\dc$}

\begin{solution}
$110\dc$
\end{solution}
