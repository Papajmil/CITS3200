\question A red hot iron nail is dropped into a large insulated bucket of cold water.  After some time the nail and water have reached thermal equilibrium.    Let $\D S_w$ be the entropy change of the water during this process and $\D S_n$ be the entropy change of the nail during this process. Assuming that together the water and nail form an isolated system during the process, which of the following statements is true?\\

\textmc{$\D S_w>0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_n>0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_w+\D S_n>0\,\,$}
{$\D S_w<0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_n<0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_w+\D S_n<0$}
{$\D S_w<0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_n>0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_w+\D S_n=0$}
{$\D S_w>0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_n<0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_w+\D S_n>0$}
{$\D S_w>0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_n<0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_w+\D S_n=0$}

\begin{solution}
$\D S_w>0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_n<0\quad$ and $\quad\D S_w+\D S_n>0$
\end{solution}
